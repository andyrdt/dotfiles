# Minimal tmux configuration
# tmux is a terminal multiplexer - lets you have multiple terminal sessions in one window

# Use zsh for new panes/windows (in case chsh didn't work)
# Using default-command instead of default-shell so the path is resolved at runtime
set -g default-command "zsh"

# Enable mouse support - click to switch panes, drag to resize, scroll with mouse wheel
set -g mouse on

# Use 256 colors for better terminal appearance
set -g default-terminal "xterm-256color"
